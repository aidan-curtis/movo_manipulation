# Server Side for the ORB_SLAM2 to PointCloud system #
######################################################

The image_receiver.py file is the main file where most of the functions are.

When run from the command line it takes two arguments:

	-SAVE (default=False): tells the program whether to save the incoming images and poses 
	information

	- FROM_SAVED (default=False): tells the program whther to compute the point cloud from
	saved information or communicate with Movo to get the data 


For example to run generate a point cloud from the saved images, you would use the 
following command:

	python image_receiver.py False True

Inside the root fo the directory you will find the following folders and files:

	-rgb: contains the rgb images from the last saved run

	-depth: contains the depth images from the last saved run
	
	-saved_for_later: folder that contains previous runs in case that more than one run 
	wants to be saved. You would have to replace the folders and files in the root of this
	directory with that of the pointcloud you want to generate

	-extrinsic2pyramid: an external library used for some visualizations. Probably will
	get rid of it

	- display_poses.py: use it to visualize the camera trajectories in 3D.

	- movo_camera_parameters.yml: file used by ORB_SLAM2 to get the parameters of the
	camera

	- slam_images.txt: contains the info and mapping of the rgb and depth images for each
	frame

	- KeyFrameTrajectory.txt: the file generated by ORB_SLAM2 for the saved run with the
	poses of the camera key frames

	- image_receiver.py: main file for pointcloud generation. See description above

	- downsample_images.py: unused. Probably will delete later.
